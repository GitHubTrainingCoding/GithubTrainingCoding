# INITIALIZE USER VARIABLES FIRST: Declare a value for them before they're [input]

# x = input("How much did you invest? ")
# print(x)
# ``this will get input from the user and save it in the variable [x], and print to screen``

# y = "Bitcoin"
#``this will declare the value of the variable [y]``

#rules: no spaces, case sensitive, cannot start with a number, stick to one convention

# print("Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName) 
#`` this prints a string, then a variable, then a space, then a variable

# message = 'Hello world' 
# print(message.lower()) 
# print(message.upper()) 
# print(message.swapcase())
#`` STRING FUNCTIONS to modify case of user's input to variable [message]

#challenge: write a program that allows a user to modify a story.
